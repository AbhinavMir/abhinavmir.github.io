title: Random Notes from reth-evm

This is different from my "Stolen notes on EVM" post, which is now deleted, but some of you might have seen it. These are some pointers I've been collecting when 1) writing solidity code, 2) contributing to reth-evm, 3) talking to friends (yes, I have friends) about EVM.
