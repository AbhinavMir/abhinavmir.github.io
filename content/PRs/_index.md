# Open Source Work 

Some are WIP, will probably add in context after completing. Since I am on a time-crunch right now (looking for work within the next 60 days), I'm a bit behind on schedule :(

  
1. Port POSIX APIs to Zephyr RTOS (Zephyr)
2. Extract register information for RISC-V from SAIL ISA definitions into JSON (RISC-V)
3. Improve incompatible solidity versions error formatting (Hardhat)
4. Extract tests in test/libsolidity/ViewPureChecker.cpp to syntaxTests/viewPureChecker (Solidity)
5. Implement dbeug_traceCallMany (nethermind)
6. Store fallback peers in TransactionFetcher as a (PeerId, usize) tuple (RETH)
7. Track unique tx hashes in valid announcement data (RETH)
8. Support suggested priority fee sampling. (Foundry)
9. Mutiny Node BIP39 fix (Mutiny)
10. Improve Mapping::find_match to return error when multiple replacements are possible. (Sway)
11. Added missing malloc check in libpayload in Coreboot (Coreboot)
12. mq_open lacks support of "mode" argument (RTEMS)
