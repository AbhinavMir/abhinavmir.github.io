Other name(s): August Radjoe.


I am a graduate of the M.S Computer Science program at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cs/). Currently, I am helping improve the [sail](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/) spec for RISC-V. Before this, I was an RA/Intern at [Multiparty](https://multiparty.org/) where I worked on a [secure multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) library. I love reading and writing, so I built out [episodic.work](https://episodic.work) to help me episodically write my book (1 fiction, 1 about history of kernels), and I also love having a nice notes app but then I forget things, so I built out [thoughtforest.xyz](https://thoughtforest.xyz) to send me AI-generated reminders weekly about things I did. Both these things are side-projects so they are incomplete on many fronts. 

I am currently looking for opportunities in North America, you can reach out to me [sabhinav@bu.edu](mailto:sabhinav@bu.edu)!

[Here](/about) is why you should hire me.

I'll also try to keep my [book recommendations](https://bookshelf.so/augustradjoe) updated.
