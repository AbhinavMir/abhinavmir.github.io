I am a graduate of the M.S Computer Science program at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cs/). I was last an intern at [Multiparty](https://multiparty.org/) where I worked on a [secure multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) library. I am currently looking for opportunities of any kind in North America, as long as it's in the field of computer science. 

[Here](/about) is why you should hire me.
