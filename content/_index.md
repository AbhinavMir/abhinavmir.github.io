Other name(s): August Radjoe.


Currently, I am working at Athelas/Commure on intergating our software with EHRs as a backend engineer and also trying to find time to complete my MS E.E @ CU Boulder. Before this, I was a firmware engineer @ a hardware company building inference machines for open source AI models. 

I graduated M.S Computer Science program at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) in January, 2024. In the past, I was helping improve the [sail](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/) spec for RISC-V. Before this, I was an RA/Intern at [Multiparty](https://multiparty.org/) where I worked on a [secure multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) library.
