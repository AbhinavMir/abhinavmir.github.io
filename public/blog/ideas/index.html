<p>I have a pragmatic way of building things. Modern medicine wouldn&rsquo;t be the same if Julius Richard Petri hadn&rsquo;t developed Petri dish. Dr. Petri did not &ldquo;invent&rdquo; much after this, and his work is mostly overshadowed by the Petridish. Medicine, and the rest of sciences, is filled with quiet, small wonders such as this, that change the world. I do not claim to be the next Dr. Petri, I am nowhere as intelligent, but I want to use his work as a pointer to the fact that small ideas change world. Big ideas and ambitious leaders are needed, and living in Boston, I meet such people often. I hope to have such an idea (and my work in decentralized finance is motivated by inspiring trustless approach to assets), but these ideas are small. These are projects I will build because I need it, or I come up with as I approach topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>[] Progress picture tracker - Shapez sucks and uses their own server. I&rsquo;m sure my pictures are encrypted, but I&rsquo;d rather it point to my server, or not at all, and gives me an option to zip, encrypt and mail to myself.</li>
<li>[] Third party Audiobook listener - All current ones suck, and do not support DRM unlock when connecting to Amazon the way Apple books does. I want it to be legal, but I want it to keep my progress. I also want it to be on Linux and Android. I&rsquo;ve made some decent progress here.</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> Episodic publishing of literature. Amazon&rsquo;s Vella, but actually good. (built, unlaunched: episodic.work)</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> A portfolio of Pull requests (built, unlaunched: pullrequests.me)</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> A platform to practice ZK circuit buildings (built, unlaunched: r1cs.xyz)</li>
