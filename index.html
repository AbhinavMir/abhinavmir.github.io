    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Currently I am @ Simbie AI, where I am a founding engineer working on voice-agent focused healthcare products among other things.</p>
    
    <p>Before this, I was @ Commure, as one of the first engineers on the EHR Integration team - where we took our AI Scribe and integrated it with EHRs/EMRs/MRSes. Healthcare Backoffice is my ikigai. I am obsessed with reducing burnout amongst healthcare professionals, and it helps I love programming and productionizing software.</p>

    <p>I blog mostly at <a href="https://mataroa.blog/">Mataroa</a>, where I write things my coworkers shouldn't read. After years of maintaining my own blog, I decided Mataroa was the business I want to support - they're excellent, markdown-friendly, and very affordable.</p>
    
    <p>I graduated from the M.S Computer Science program at Boston University in January, 2024 - this was when I first came to the US, and thus Boston has become what I still think of as home (Go Celtics!), though now I live in Mountain View by the downtown (also go Warriors!) - if you're here and would want to grab a coffee, my <a href="https://cal.com/abhinavmir/meet?user=abhinavmir&duration=15">Calendar</a> is open (I don't mind e-meets either!).</p>
    
    <p>In the past, I was helping improve the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/" target="_blank">sail</a> spec for RISC-V. Before this, I was an RA/Intern at <a href="https://multiparty.org/" target="_blank">Multiparty</a> where I worked on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation" target="_blank">secure multi-party computation</a> library. I've also done a lot of Crypto work I don't talk about much since my focus now is exclusively healthcare, but I do believe Ethereum and Cosmos-type app-chains are the future of consensus, but the bad actors need a deep purge.</p>

    <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Owning many core workflows @ Commure, helping grow a small team and bringing in ~$1M in ARR directly or indirectly</li>
        <li>Top 10% when I applied to YC - it ain't much, but it's honest work</li>
        <li>Published my house album to most streaming platforms</li>
        <li>Libreprose has 3 users, I am one of them, and I'm working on some SciFi books. I feel India sorely lacks SciFi, and I'm trying to change that. SciFi is the sign of a progressing society</li>
        <li>Hopefully, helping Simbie grow to a multi-million dollar company. I love the team and the product!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>This is my unpublished research that is open source. This isn't pre-print, this is just a collection of my work that I have not published yet at all, and lots of work is left.</p>

    <h3>Current Research Areas</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>A FHIR-optimized time-series database for continuous patient monitoring (<a href="https://github.com/abhinavmir/emberdb">repo</a>) - I found out my implementation sucks, work in progress</li>
       <li>Using Multiparty Computing to find anonymised cost of care for patients - purely theoretical, I'm not sure how much this is actually useful. After working in healthcare, I've realized how sensitive hospitals are to data sharing</li>
       <li>Using interactive zero-knowledge proofs for negative STR DNA match proofs - Also theoretical, technically complete, written in Python, but practically still struggling with the problem of finding the right fit</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Published Work</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9395806">Application of Nature-Inspired Swarm Optimization Algorithms in Artificial Neural Networks</a></li>
    </ul>
